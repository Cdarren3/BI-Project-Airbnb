# Tableau Dashboard with AirBnB Dataset

## Introduction
AirBnB is well known as one of the go-to choices for tourists apart from traditional hotels. While COVID19 heavily impacted tourism globally, we would like to investigate how the Hong Kong users in AirBnB coped with the current situation, from both the perspective of tenants and hosts. We will focus on the following 4 points,
1. General Introduction to the dataset
2. Difference between 2019 and 2020
3. Insight for AirBnB hosts
4. Insight for AirBnB tenants

## Data Source

## Findings

#### Insight for Hosts
- New hosts with good performace are predominantly concentrated in Islands and Yau Tsim Mong District
- Rent of private room is less than half of that of whole apartment in the same district on average
- New Sai Kung hosts should target to set the price below $1500 for an apartment and $400 for a private room to be competitive
