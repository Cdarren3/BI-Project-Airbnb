# Tableau Dashboard with AirBnB Dataset

## Introduction
AirBnB is well known as one of the go-to choices for tourists apart from traditional hotels. While COVID19 heavily impacted tourism globally, we would like to investigate how the Hong Kong users in AirBnB coped with the current situation, from both the perspective of tenants and hosts. We will focus on the following 4 points,
1. General Introduction to the dataset
2. Difference between 2019 and 2020
3. Insight for AirBnB hosts
4. Insight for AirBnB tenants

## Data Source
Only the data of Hong Kong is used. Related files are within the repository. <br />
